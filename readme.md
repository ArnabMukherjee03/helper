# Helper - Atm Cash Avalability Tracker

The primary objective of the ATM Cash Availability Tracker is to provide a user-friendly, real-time platform for individuals to locate nearby ATMs with available cash, reducing the frustration of futile trips to cashless machines, particularly in unfamiliar places or during nighttime hours. The project empowers users to actively engage in maintaining accurate ATM data, creating a reliable and community-driven resource that enhances overall banking convenience.
